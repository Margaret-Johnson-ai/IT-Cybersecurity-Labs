Subject: Access Restored – Office 365 Login Issue Resolved

Hi Jane,

This is a follow-up regarding the issue you experienced logging into Microsoft 365 due to a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) lockout.

After reviewing your account, I was able to reset your MFA settings and confirmed that your access has been successfully restored. You should now be able to log in using your credentials. If prompted, please reconfigure your MFA using the Microsoft Authenticator app.

Here are a few tips for smooth sign-in:
- Make sure your Authenticator app is updated
- Avoid switching devices without notifying IT support
- Contact us promptly if you encounter login delays or errors

If you run into any issues, don’t hesitate to reply to this message or open a new support ticket.

Thank you,
