# 💼 Helpdesk Analyst Simulation Lab

_A hands-on, real-world simulation project designed to showcase practical IT Support skills for Helpdesk Analyst roles._

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This lab simulates the daily responsibilities of a Helpdesk Analyst, including:

- Active Directory tasks (user creation, group management)
- Office 365 troubleshooting and support
- Ticketing system workflow documentation
- Hardware/software deployments
- Remote support walkthroughs
- Documentation and communication practices

The goal is to demonstrate entry-level IT support expertise in a structured and recruiter-friendly format.

## 🛠 Simulation Tasks

### ✅ Active Directory Tasks
- Created 3 new users with varying roles
- Assigned users to appropriate groups
- Reset passwords and documented actions

### ✅ Office 365 Simulation
- Simulated login failure and MFA lockout
- Drafted resolution steps including license verification

### ✅ Ticket Documentation
- Created 2 realistic support tickets:
  - **HD-001**: Office 365 MFA Lockout  
  - **HD-002**: WiFi Network Connectivity Issue

Each ticket includes:
- Summary, resolution steps, follow-up
- Screenshot documentation for evidence

### ✅ Device Troubleshooting
- Simulated a printer error and Wi-Fi issue
- Used command-line diagnostics and Windows settings

### ✅ Communication Practice
- Wrote a sample support summary email to a user
- Focused on tone, clarity, and user reassurance

## 📌 Why This Project Stands Out

Unlike basic IT lab examples, this simulation recreates **authentic Helpdesk tasks** including:

- 📋 Clear documentation and escalation notes  
- 🧩 Real-world user scenarios  
- 🖥️ GUI and PowerShell-based demonstrations  
- 🎯 A clean, recruiter-facing GitHub presentation  

Perfect for:

- Entry-level job applications  
- Showcasing transferable and self-taught IT skills  
- Demonstrating hands-on capability with no prior job experience

## ✅ Final Project Recap

This Helpdesk Analyst Simulation Lab gave me the opportunity to practice and document what it’s like working in a real IT Support role.

🔹 I walked through scenarios like account lockouts, Wi-Fi troubleshooting, and created realistic helpdesk tickets.  
🔹 I used PowerShell and CMD to simulate common fixes.  
🔹 I drafted a clear and respectful follow-up email to demonstrate my communication style.

This project reflects my current capabilities, my problem-solving mindset, and my ability to communicate technical issues effectively — all important qualities in a Helpdesk or IT Support role.
