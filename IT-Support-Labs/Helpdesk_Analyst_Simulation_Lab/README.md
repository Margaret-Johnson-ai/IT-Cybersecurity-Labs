# 💼 Helpdesk Analyst Simulation Lab

_A hands-on, real-world simulation project designed to showcase practical IT Support skills for Helpdesk Analyst roles._

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
This lab simulates the daily responsibilities of a Helpdesk Analyst, including:

- Active Directory tasks (user creation, group management)
- Office 365 troubleshooting and support
- Ticketing system workflow documentation
- Hardware/software deployments
- Remote support walkthroughs
- Documentation and communication practices

The goal is to demonstrate entry-level IT support expertise in a structured and recruiter-friendly format.

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- Windows 10 (User VM) and Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)
- Active Directory Users & Computers (ADUC)
- Microsoft 365 Admin Center (simulated environment)
- PowerShell and Command Prompt
- GitHub Desktop for version control
- Screenshots and logs for documentation

## 🛠 Simulation Tasks

### ✅ Active Directory Tasks
- Create 3 new users with varying roles
- Add them to appropriate security/distribution groups
- Reset passwords and document logs

### ✅ Office 365 Simulation
- Simulate login failure scenario
- Create and document resolution steps (e.g., MFA lockout, license misassignment)

### ✅ Ticket Documentation
- Simulate 2 realistic support tickets:
  - **HD-001**: Office 365 MFA Lockout
  - **HD-002**: WiFi Network Connectivity Issue

Each includes:
- Ticket summary, steps taken, resolution, and follow-up
- Linked screenshot reference in `/Screenshots/`

### ✅ Device Troubleshooting
- Simulate a printer and Wi-Fi connection issue
- Provide command-line diagnostics and user guidance

### ✅ Communication Practice
- Draft a sample support summary email to a user
- Include clear, concise steps with respectful tone

## 📌 Why This Project Stands Out
Unlike generic IT lab setups, this simulation replicates real Helpdesk operations including:

- Clear documentation practices
- Real-world user scenarios
- A recruiter-facing presentation layout
- PowerShell and GUI-based demonstrations

It is ideal for:
- Entry-level job applications
- Showcasing transferable skills
- Proving hands-on capability without a formal job background

---

## 🔄 Next Steps
- [ ] Complete final PowerShell commands and logs
- [ ] Draft summary user email (communication practice)
- [ ] Begin drafting LinkedIn post to showcase this project
