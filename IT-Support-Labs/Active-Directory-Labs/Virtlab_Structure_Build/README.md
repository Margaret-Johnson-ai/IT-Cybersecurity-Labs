# 🏗️ Active Directory Lab: Virtlab Structure Build

This project is part of my hands-on journey into IT support and Active Directory management. I built this lab from scratch using Windows Server 2022 and Windows 11 to simulate how real IT teams manage users, OUs, GPOs, file shares, and administrative tasks in a business environment.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project was to learn and demonstrate how to:

- Build a domain environment with structured Organizational Units (OUs)
- Add and manage users and service accounts
- Apply group policies for security and productivity
- Automate drive mapping based on user group
- Simulate recovery steps and admin troubleshooting

I treated this like a real internal IT setup—documenting everything as I went.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)
- Windows 11 Client Machine
- Active Directory Users & Computers (ADUC)
- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
- PowerShell
- CMD & BAT scripting
- GitHub Desktop (for documentation and version control)

## 🔄 How I Set It Up

If you're learning like I am and want to try this yourself, here’s the basic flow I followed:

1. Installed and promoted a Windows Server 2022 VM to Domain Controller.
2. Created OUs for HR, IT, Sales, and Service Accounts.
3. Added users manually and documented password policies.
4. Wrote PowerShell scripts for drive mapping and user creation.
5. Set up and tested GPOs for folder redirection and login permissions.
6. Captured screenshots and backed up my setup using GitHub.

## ✅ What This Project Shows

This lab shows that I’m not just learning theory—I’m taking initiative to set up environments, troubleshoot issues, and simulate real admin work. I’ve included visual documentation and scripts to reflect what I’d do in a real help desk or sysadmin role.

I’m excited to keep building on this foundation.
