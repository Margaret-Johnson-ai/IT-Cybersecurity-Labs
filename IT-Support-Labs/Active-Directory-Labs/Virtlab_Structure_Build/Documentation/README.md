# üóÇÔ∏è AD Lab Documentation Folder

This folder contains documentation files that support my Active Directory Virtual Lab, built to simulate a real-world IT environment with users, OUs, GPOs, and scripts.

Each file here reflects a step in the planning, execution, and troubleshooting process of configuring Active Directory in a small enterprise setup. My goal with this lab was to show my ability to think through structure, apply policy, and document clearly like I would in a real support or sysadmin role.

## üìÅ Files Included

- **AD_User_Accounts_Reference.txt**  
  A breakdown of all domain users created manually or via script, including usernames, OU placement, passwords, group membership, and email formatting rules.

- **AD_Lab_Structure_Plan.txt**  
  A planning document explaining my OU layout (HR, Sales, IT, Service Accounts), group design, and GPO mapping strategy.

- **AD_Lab_Rollout_Notes.md**  
  Ongoing notes I logged throughout the lab: roadblocks, troubleshooting steps, and lessons learned during account creation, GPO testing, and script deployment.

- **GPO_Backup_Procedure.txt**  
  A real-world PowerShell backup method to preserve GPOs after configuring security and folder redirection policies. Helps with rollback or migration.

üí° *Why This Folder Matters*  
In real IT environments, documentation matters just as much as execution. This folder gives insight into how I structure work, communicate technical intent, and leave behind useful artifacts for other admins.
