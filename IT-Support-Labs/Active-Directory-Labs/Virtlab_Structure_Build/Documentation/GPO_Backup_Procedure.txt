GPO Backup & Restore Procedure
====================================

This procedure outlines how I performed a backup and potential restoration of all Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in my lab domain (MJVIRTLAB). I created this as part of my real-world Active Directory lab to simulate IT administrator best practices.

üóÇÔ∏è Backup GPOs to a designated folder:

Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator  
Step 2: Create a backup directory:
    mkdir C:\GPO_Backups

Step 3: Run the following command to back up all GPOs:
    Backup-GPO -All -Path "C:\GPO_Backups"

Step 4: Confirm backups were created:
    Get-ChildItem "C:\GPO_Backups"

üîÅ Restore GPO from backup (when needed):

Step 1: Identify the GPO backup you want to restore  
Step 2: Use the following command:
    Restore-GPO -Name "Your-GPO-Name" -Path "C:\GPO_Backups"

üìù Notes:
- Always run these commands from a domain controller or PowerShell session with GPMC module installed.
- This backup method preserves all settings including folder redirection, software policies, and login banners.
- Folder `C:\GPO_Backups` can be copied externally for offsite or disaster recovery simulation.
