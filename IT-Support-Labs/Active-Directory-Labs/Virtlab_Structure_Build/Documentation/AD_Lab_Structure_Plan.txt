Active Directory Lab - OU & Group Design Structure Overview
============================================================

📌 Purpose:
The goal of this AD structure is to simulate a real-world small to mid-sized company that separates users and policies based on department, role, and IT support needs.

🧩 OU Structure:
- OU: HR
  - Sub-OU: Users
  - Sub-OU: Computers
  - GPO: Folder Redirection (HRDocs)
  
- OU: Sales
  - Sub-OU: Users
  - Sub-OU: Computers
  - GPO: Limit Control Panel, Restrict Tools (SalesDocs)

- OU: IT
  - Sub-OU: Users
  - Sub-OU: Computers
  - GPO: Access to Admin Tools, PS scripts, Redirection to ITDocs

- OU: Service_Accounts
  - Used for non-interactive or scheduled backup accounts (e.g., svcBackup)

🔐 Security Groups Created:
- HR_Group
- Sales_Team
- IT_Support

👩🏽‍💼 User Placement:
- Sandra Wallace → HR > Users
- Amanda Sales → Sales > Users
- Tom Green → IT > Users
- svcBackup → Service_Accounts

🧠 Reasoning Behind the Structure:
- Keeping users and computers separated makes it easier to link GPOs and avoid accidental inheritance.
- Creating GPOs per department reflects how many orgs apply role-based access and control.
- OU-based redirection ensures data can be backed up or audited per department (HRDocs, SalesDocs, ITDocs).
- Service accounts are isolated for auditing and security purposes.

🛠️ Tools Used:
- Active Directory Users & Computers (ADUC)
- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
- PowerShell (for backup and scripted deployments)
- VMware Workstation for the virtual environment

✅ Status: Fully implemented and tested with login confirmation and policy application.
